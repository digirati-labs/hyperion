# Hyperion
Experimental framework for IIIF in JavaScript and Typescript.

Aims to provide safe typings for valid Presentation 3 JSON-LD and normalization step (also with typings). 

3 steps in that the library does:
- Preprocess resources to ensure valid Presentation 3
- Cast JSON to Typescript interface
- Normalize resources into flat tree of resources

This library can be the basis of other tools that want to work deeper with IIIF Presentation 3 resources.
