# React Vault
React hooks are, hands down, the best way to work with IIIF.

## The elevator pitch

### Setting the stage
### Using some hooks
### Adding reactivity

## New to React?
This section of the documentation will be both a reference for people using the hooks and features
of React Vault and also a great introduction to React for developers who are already familiar with 
IIIF.

There will be a lot more interactive code sandboxes, snippets and explanations. If Vue is more your
flavour, keep an eye out for the Vue Vault coming soon.
