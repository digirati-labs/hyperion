# Simple viewer context


This will be the context to use to get a basic IIIF viewer up and running.
It will not focus on having compatibility with the full range of IIIF
resources, instead offering a viewer for a Manifest, cycling through canvases
while ignoring the paged/facing-pages/continuous behaviors.

There will not be support for canvas-on-canvas annotations. Annotations will
be filtered, giving details of the canvas space and images to be annotated
onto that space. The demo implementation of this viewer will use
OpenSeadragon to display.

Navigation functions will include the basics:
- nextCanvas()
- previousCanvas()
- goToCanvas(id)
- goToCanvasIndex(idx)
- goToFirstCanvas()
- goToLastCanvas()

It will take in only a Manifest ID and will load that Manifest when the
context loads.

There will be no support for external or embedded annotation lists, although
you can set up a nested context to support this.

There will be no support for ranges in this view.

To use this component, first you will need the provider:
```js
import { SimpleViewerProvider } from '...';


<SimpleViewerProvider id="http://example.org/manifest.json">
  <CustomComponent />
</SimpleViewerProvider>
```
This is in addition to the core Vault context further up the tree.

In components that you want to use parts of the state you can grab the hooks
from this file.
```js
import { useSimpleViewer } from '...';
```
And use them in your components to get the actions.

```js
function NextButton() {
  const { nextCanvas } = useSimpleViewer();

  return <button onClick={nextCanvas}>Next</button>;
}
```

Since this is a single-context, there is only ever one manifest, canvas and
annotation list. You can access the current resource using the normal hooks.
```js
function CanvasMetadata() {
  const metadata = useCanvas(metadataSelector);

  return <div> ... </div>
}
```

So long as this is inside the provider, it will have the correct context.
