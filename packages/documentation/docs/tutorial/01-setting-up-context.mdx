# Setting up context

In order to use the features provided by the framework, we need to wrap our application in a component called a **provider**.
This provider will allow any components we write further down in our application can access the same IIIF resources and share some state.

To add the provider we simple wrap our application in `<VaultProvider />`


import { SettingUpContext } from '../../src/sandboxes/setting-up-context.csb';

<SettingUpContext />
