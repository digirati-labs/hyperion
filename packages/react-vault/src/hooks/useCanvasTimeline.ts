// A canvas timeline is a flat array of objects containing all of the resources from 0 to the canvas duration.
// It only applied to canvases with a duration.
// It will give the resources with a start and end time, to make it easier to creating a UI out of it.
// Annotation ids will also be present for getting more data out using `fromRef`
