// A virtual canvas is a canvas that does not exist, but looks and acts like a normal canvas.
// Typically a virtual canvas will be a composite of 2 or more canvases drawn onto a third canvas.
// This can be difficult to work with, so a virtual canvas can be used which will extract and combine the
// painting annotations of the children canvases into a single canvas with paining annotations.
